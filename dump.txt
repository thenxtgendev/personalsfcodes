### **High-Level Design**

1. The **Screen Flow** begins with a **Lookup Component** to allow the director to search for and select a user from the **User** object, storing the user's ID for further processing.

2. A **Get Records** element retrieves existing `PermissionSetAssignment` records for the selected user.

3. Logical mappings between user-friendly options and permission sets are stored in a **Custom Metadata Type** for easy maintenance.

4. A **custom LWC** embedded in the flow dynamically displays the retrieved assignments in a **table format** with user-friendly labels.

5. Each row in the table includes a **Delete Icon**, which, when clicked, triggers a backend operation to delete the corresponding permission sets using the logical mapping.

6. The table also includes an **Add Permission Icon**, which redirects to a screen displaying available user-friendly options for assigning new permission sets.

7. The flow maps the selected options from the add screen to their corresponding permission set IDs via the **Custom Metadata** and creates `PermissionSetAssignment` records.

8. Privileged operations (e.g., create/delete assignments) are delegated to an **Autolaunched Flow** or **Apex Invocable Action** running in **System Mode** to avoid requiring elevated user permissions.

9. Security is ensured by restricting access to the flow, LWC, and Apex methods using **custom permissions** and object-level restrictions.

10. The design combines dynamic interactivity through LWCs, logical flexibility via Custom Metadata, and secure execution in System Mode for a robust, scalable solution.
